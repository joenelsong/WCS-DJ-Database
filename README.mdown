set up webpage @ http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~jnelson/wcs_dj_db/findCust.html

created WCS.sql database on mysql server on jnelson@ix.uoregon.edu

Cool stuff:

- Automated Python Script to add grab Track information from online radio station and add to MYSQLDB. It adds to both Track and RadioStation_has_Tracks Tables.
	- script runs indefinately, polling the RadioStation periodically and updating the database in realtime.
	
- DJ's can register with my system, so that we can try and code up an automated way of tracking their playlists
