set up webpage @http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~jnelson/wcs_dj_db/db.html

created WCS.sql database on mysql server on jnelson@ix.uoregon.edu

Cool stuff:

- Automated Python Script to add grab Track information from online radio station and add to MYSQLDB. It adds to both Track and RadioStation_has_Tracks Tables.
	- script runs continuously and as you read this (it is hosted on my home server, because ix wouldn't let me install mysqldb for python) it is polling a WCS RadioStation periodically (~ every 10-20 minutes) and updating the database in realtime.
	
- DJ's can register with my system, so that we can try and code up an automated way of tracking their playlists
